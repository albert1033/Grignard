# Grignard Python Discord bot
Multi-purpose Discord bot. Feel free to use it, but I'd love it if you give credits.

Bot is made 100% by Python with the help of Discord.py module from Rapptz (texture prefixes).

Administrator can change the prefix of the bot. Default prefix is "$".

Download all needed modules in the requirements.txt file by pip and type "$help" for a list of command.
